# Sovryn Settlement

On this branch all functions of the limit order system were removed beside of the withdraw function.
After updating the Settlement logic users can only withdraw already deposited rBtc. 

Restore functionality if required at this commit: https://github.com/DistributedCollective/LimitOrder/commit/a728264266264360c2c7e7c9045f41c248d0de23
Please note that the Settlement contract fix in this commit requires review before deployment.
